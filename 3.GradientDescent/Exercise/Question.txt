Maths & Computer science score of 11 students are provided. 
Using Gradient descent algorithm, find the correlation coefficient & intercept between Maths & Computer Science score. 
The algorithm should stop improving when cost difference between two successive iterations become less than 10^-20. You may use math.isclose() function for the same.
Hint: You may need a very high number of iterations, trial and error to find the optimum learning rate.
